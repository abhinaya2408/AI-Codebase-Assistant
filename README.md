# AI-Codebase-Assistant

AI-Codebase-Assistant is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based GitHub repository intelligence system designed to help developers understand large codebases, retrieve repository-specific information, explain workflows, and answer technical questions using conversational AI.

The system combines semantic retrieval, keyword retrieval, conversational memory, and grounded response generation to provide accurate and repository-aware answers with source citations.

# System Workflow

The application follows a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for repository understanding and conversational code intelligence.

## Workflow Steps

1. User provides a GitHub repository URL through the Streamlit interface.
2. Repository Loader clones and scans the repository recursively.
3. Source code and documentation files are extracted.
4. Metadata enrichment attaches:
   - repository name
   - file name
   - file path
5. RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter performs intelligent chunking.
6. HuggingFace sentence-transformers generate embeddings.
7. Embeddings are stored in FAISS Vector Database.
8. BM25 creates a keyword retrieval index.
9. User submits repository-related queries.
10. Query Expansion improves technical and workflow understanding.
11. Hybrid Retrieval combines:
    - Semantic Retrieval (FAISS)
    - Keyword Retrieval (BM25)
12. Retrieval results are merged and deduplicated.
13. Conversational memory provides chat context awareness.
14. Prompt construction combines:
    - retrieved chunks
    - conversational context
    - repository metadata
    - user query
15. Grounded prompting reduces hallucinations.
16. Groq LLM generates repository-aware grounded responses.
17. Source citations are attached to the final response.
